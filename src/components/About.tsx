              Allow me to introduce myself as Jefferson Marchan Garcia, a
              23-year-old graduate from Mindanao State University â€“ Iligan
              Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer
              Application, specializing in Internet of Things. My passion for
              design has inspired me to pursue a career as a frontend web

            </h3>
            <p className="indent-8 text-justify">
              My journey into the world of web development started when I was
              fascinated by the way websites could bring ideas to life and
              connect people from around the globe. I embarked on my learning
              path by immersing myself in various online courses. This allowed
              me to build a solid foundation, and I soon discovered my true
              passion.

                  Being a frontend web developer gives me the opportunity to
                  combine my passion for technology and design. I find great
                  satisfaction in turning complex problems into elegant
                  solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.
                  Witnessing users interact with something I've built and
                  knowing that it positively impacts their lives motivates me to
                  continuously improve and stay updated with the latest industry
                  trends.
